# The Memory Game : POKE-MEM 

### For our first group project we wanted to create a memory game with a Pokemon cards theme. 

## The home page
### On the home page you will be able to either launch the game and enter in the arena by clicking on the "Start" button or read the instructions by clicking on "instructions"

## The arena

## Rules
<li> You will start by flipping over one card
<li> If the next card you flip matches, both cards remain face up and you get +1 pair guessed
<li> If the next card you flip does not match the cards flip back
<li> The game continues until you match all the cards on the board (12 pairs)
  
## Levels
### For each level of difficulty there is a timer. You must have finished the game before it ends :
<li> Level 1 : Unlimited time  😴
<li> Level 2 : 3:00  😎
<li> Level 3 : 1:30  😥
<li> Level 4 : 0:30  🥵
  
### To do this we used 3 languages : JavaScript, HTML and CSS
### We also :
<li>Select elements in the DOM with querySelector
<li>Iterate through lists with forEach
<li>Add/remove an element class
<li>Add/remove event listeners
<li>Timeout
<li>Html5: data-attribute
<li>Css3: positioning, flexbox, perspective, backface-visibility, transitions
